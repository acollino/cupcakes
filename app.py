# Part Two: Listing, Getting & Creating Cupcakes

# GET /api/cupcakes
# Get data about all cupcakes.

# Part Three: Update & Delete Cupcakes
# Make routes for the following:

# PATCH /api/cupcakes/[cupcake-id]
# Update a cupcake with the id passed in the URL and flavor, size, rating and image data from the body of the request. You can always assume that the entire cupcake object will be passed to the backend.

# This should raise a 404 if the cupcake cannot be found.

# Respond with JSON of the newly-updated cupcake, like this: {cupcake: {id, flavor, size, rating, image}}.

# DELETE /api/cupcakes/[cupcake-id]
# This should raise a 404 if the cupcake cannot be found.

# Delete cupcake with the id passed in the URL. Respond with JSON like {message: "Deleted"}.

# Test these routes in Insomnia.

# Part Four: Write More Tests
# Add tests for the PATCH and DELETE routes.
